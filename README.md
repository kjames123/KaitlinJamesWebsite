I have a Bachelor's of Public Health from Brock University and am currently pursuing my
Master's degree at the University of Toronto in Health Informatics. The program so far is
definitely a bit of a learning curve in terms of the technology and computer science based courses.
However, I am really enjoying it so far and am looking forward to learning more as the year progresses. <br/>
